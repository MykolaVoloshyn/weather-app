# Weather App
**Weather App** is a simple web application that provides real-time weather information for any city worldwide. Users can search by city name and instantly view current conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and a short weather description with icons. The app also displays the local time and date for the selected location.

This project was built for learning purposes and as part of my front-end development portfolio.
